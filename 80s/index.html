		<h1>1980s COVID Night</h1>
		<p><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88961931959">Join Zoom call</a></p>

		<h2>80s Music Quiz</h2>
		<p>Work with your partner to identify as many 1980s songs as possible from the drawing. To participate, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPmkNX54-2bOBRM2rsccd7eXeM4n_IGe5kQU0TaEBaBXuc9w/viewform?usp=sf_link">go to this form</a> <b>after</b> your hosts start the clock (which is taking the form of a nine-minute 1980's remix).</p>
		<p>Tip: You may want to mute the audio on Zoom to avoid tipping your answers to other participants.</p>
		<p>Winning couple receives a donation to the charity of their choice.</p>

		<h2>80s Family Feud - Battle of the Sexes</h2>
		<p>You'll be working against your partner on this one: Women vs. Men.</p>
		<p>We aren't going to be too prescriptive with the prize for this event, but would highly encourage members of the losing side to treat their partner with extra generosity this evening.</p>
